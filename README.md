## 📌 Overview

This project uses a stacking ensemble approach to implement a machine-learning pipeline for malware classification. 
It classifies malware samples into binary (malicious/benign), 4-class, and 16-class categories based on memory dump features.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Stacking ensemble with Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Trees as base models
- Neural network meta-learner for improved classification
- Support for binary, 4-class, and 16-class classification
- Cross-validation and multiple experiment runs for robust results
- Model saving functionality

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the [Obfuscated-MalMem2022](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/malmem-2022.html) dataset. 
This dataset is in CSV format with the following structure:
- 55 feature columns 
- 'Category': File name containing malware family name and subcategory
- 'Class': Binary class (Benign/Malicious)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/malware-classification.git
   cd malware-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 💻 Usage

1. Ensure your dataset is in the correct location.
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python malware_classification.py
   ```
3. The script will preprocess the data, run experiments, print results, and save the best models.

## 🔧 Customization

You can customize various aspects of the pipeline:
- Number of features selected (default: 16)
- Number of experiment runs (default: 5)
- Neural network architecture of the meta-learner
- Base models used in the ensemble

Modify the respective functions in `malware_classification.py` to implement these customizations.

## 📊 Results

The script outputs average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each classification type after multiple experiment runs. Detailed results and model components are saved in the following directories:
- `/content/saved_model_binary`
- `/content/saved_model_4class`
- `/content/saved_model_16class`
