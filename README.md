## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

Peace of Mind is an advanced malware detection system that combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with a user-friendly web interface. Our goal is to provide robust protection against various types of malware, including trojans, spyware, and ransomware.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes a stacking ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Trees classifiers with a neural network meta-learner.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Supports binary (malicious/benign), 4-class, and 16-class malware categorization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web application for easy file scanning and result visualization.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics and system management tools for administrators.
- **Real-Time Scanning**: Quick and efficient scanning of uploaded files.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Visual representation of scan results and malware trends.

## üíª Tech Stack and Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vue.js
- **Visualization**: Plotly

### Backend
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **Machine Learning**:
  - scikit-learn (for model performance analysis)
  - pandas (for dataset insights)
  - Base Learners: Random Forest, XGBoost, Extra Trees Classifier
  - Meta Learner: Neural Network

### Storage
- **User Data/Results**: SQLite
- **Models/Datasets**: MinIO or free-tier S3 bucket

### Authentication
Handled between Frontend and FastAPI

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

1. **Frontend**: Vue.js based user interface with Plotly for visualizations.
2. **Backend**: FastAPI server handling requests, file uploads, and serving data.
3. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Processes data for malware detection and analysis.
4. **Storage**: 
   - SQLite for user data and results
   - MinIO/S3 for storing models and datasets

The FastAPI backend validates files/data before saving and provides data to the frontend. It also manages the interaction between the user interface and the machine learning components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/peace-of-mind.git
   cd peace-of-mind
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up MinIO or configure S3 bucket (instructions to be added).

5. Initialize the SQLite database (instructions to be added).

6. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

7. In a new terminal, set up and run the Vue.js frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run serve
   ```

## üìä Usage

### For Users
1. Register for an account on the Peace of Mind platform.
2. Log in to your dashboard.
3. Upload files for scanning using the provided interface.
4. View detailed scan results and malware analysis visualized with Plotly.

### For Administrators
1. Access the admin dashboard using provided credentials.
2. Monitor system performance, user activity, and malware trends.
3. Manage the malware database and model performance.

## üß† Machine Learning Model

Our core ML model uses a stacking ensemble approach:
- Base models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Extra Trees
- Meta-learner: Neural Network
- Supports binary, 4-class, and 16-class malware classification

For more details on the ML pipeline, refer to `ml_model/README.md`.
